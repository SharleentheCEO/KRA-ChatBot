    "The **Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA)** plays a critical role in national development by collecting taxes that fund public services and infrastructure. However, many citizens face challenges navigating Kenya’s complex tax ecosystem. Taxpayers—especially small business owners, first-time filers, informal sector workers, and youth—often struggle to understand their tax obligations, registration processes, deadlines, and compliance procedures.This leads to widespread confusion, delays in filing, non-compliance, and an overburdened KRA support system.\n",

    "In Kenya, taxpayer education remains a significant barrier to improving compliance and understanding of the tax system. Many Kenyans struggle with filing taxes on time, understanding how much to pay, and navigating the KRA iTax system. Despite the resources available on the KRA website, clarity and accessibility of information remain a challenge. Taxpayers often face delays and confusion when trying to access support or find accurate information. Additionally, the language barriers between English and Swahili further hinder accessibility. The KRA Chatbot addresses these challenges by providing an AI powered, bilingual chatbot capable of handling the KRA-related queries with precision and also ensures that users receive relevant responses."
